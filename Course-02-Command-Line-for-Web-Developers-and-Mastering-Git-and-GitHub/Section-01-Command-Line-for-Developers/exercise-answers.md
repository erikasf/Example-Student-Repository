##Answers to questions
1. What is the cd?
    change directory. Changes the current working directory to the directory $DIR. In effect, moves you around the computer. For example to move into a directory or folder thats found in Documents you would use 
    cd Documents/practice or to go back home cd ~
2. What is the exit command
    When you are done wiht a terminal window or tab and ready to exit you use the exit command  which is ```$ exit```
    but when you want to quit the man pages you don't use exit you use :q for quit. 
    Bash's exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script.
3.pwd?
    pwd is an acronym for print working directory. the pwd is one of the most frequently used commands.
    it can be used to find the full path to the current directory which is just the directory that you are currently operating in . 
    Syntax is 
    ```
    pwd
    pwd [options]
    var = $(pwd)
    echo "The current working director $var"
    ```
    to print current dir. 
    ```
    $ pwd
    /user/underpaidnurse (is mine)
    ```
